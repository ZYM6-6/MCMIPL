More descriptions are available via the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11775.pdf).

The code is partially referred to [UNICORN](https://github.com/dengyang17/unicorn) and [SCPR](https://github.com/farrecall/SCPR).

## Environment Settings
python: 3.7.9

pytorch: 1.7.1 

dgl: 0.6.0

## Data Preparation
We have released the data, including lastfm_start, yelp_star,Amazon-Book and MovieLens.

If you would like to use your own dataset, you can reference the following step.
1. Put the user-item interaction data into the  fold /data/<data_name>, you can see the detail in [SCPR](https://github.com/farrecall/SCPR).
2. Processing data: `python graph_init.py --data_name <data_name>`
3. Use TransE [[OpenKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE)] to pretrain the graph embeddings. And put the pretrained embeddings under "/tmp/<data_name>/embeds/".


## Training
`python RL_model.py --data_name <data_name>`

## Evaluation
`python evaluate.py --data_name <data_name> --load_rl_epoch <checkpoint_epoch>`
